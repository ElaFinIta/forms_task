# Controlled forms task with REACT

An exercise done at Business College Helsinki to practice REACT and controlled forms.

## Built with:

- REACT
- JavaScript/JXS
- CSS

## Setup and usage:

Fill in the form and see your information appearing in the notepad. Submit the form and see a pop-up card that summarizes the information filled in and asks confirmation for submitting.


Submitting is executed by posting into a mock server. To test it, run 

```shell
npm run server
```

### Disclaimer:

The notepad in the View component with the red line is made using *grid*. It requires *empty divs* in the View component. This may be not the best solution.
Another (better?) way to accomplish the same result can be seen at CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-notebook-design-with-css/
